# LED Strip Driver WeMos D1 Mini Shield

These are the [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) design files for a Shield for the WeMos D1 Mini that can be used to drive LED strips.

This is designed to be a compact, reusable, versatile, and web-connected design to allow for quick lighting solutions, as well as other simple, relatively high current generic driving applications.

The template for the WeMos D1 Mini shield came from jerome-labidurie's [Kicad tools for Wemos D1 mini](https://github.com/jerome-labidurie/d1_mini_kicad).
